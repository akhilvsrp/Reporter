Technique,Description
Anchor effect,This is the common human tendency to rely too heavily on the first piece of information offered (the “anchor”) when making decisions. 
Attention Ratio,"This is a design principle according to which the ratio of the number of actions that can be taken on a page to the number of actions you want a user to take on the page (conversion goals, that is) should be 1:1. Psychologically stating, a person is more likely to focus on an action and follow it through if there is only one action that can be taken on each page. "
Authority endorsement,This is a type of social proof in which we tend to follow the advice or recommendation of someone we deem as an authority figure in the domain. 
Cognitive Ease,"This refers to the ease with which our brain processes information and reacts to it. We feel more ease than strain when information is presented more clearly, when we experience something repeatedly, or when we are in a good mood. The cognitive ease associated with something will alter our own feelings about that thing and whether or not we are motivated to invest our time and effort in it. "
Cost-benefit analysis ,"A system 2 behaviour, this is  a systematic approach to estimating the strengths and weaknesses of alternatives used to determine options that provide the best way of achieving benefits while preserving savings."
Curse of knowledge ,"The phenomenon when one party in a two-way communication assumes that the other party(ies) already have the background to understand what they are saying. It means that once we know something, we find it hard to imagine not knowing it, and we tend to assume that the other person also knows as much or at least some of what we know. "
Decoy effect ,"It is the phenomenon whereby consumers will tend to change their preference between two options when presented with a third option that is asymmetrically dominated, i.e. is way better or way worse than one of the original two options."
Endowment Effect/Loss Aversion,"The phenomenon in which people attach a greater value to what they own and have already invested in, and will not be ready to part with what they already have. "
Extrinsic/Intrinsic Cognitive Load,"Cognitive load is the amount of working memory that is used by an individual when performing a task. Intrinsic cognitive load refers to the effort needed to complete a task, while extrinsic cognitive load is the way the information about a task is presented to the user. "
Fogg Behaviour Model,"The Fogg Behaviour Model postulates that a behaviour can occur only when 3 elements come together: Motivation, Ability, and a Trigger. When even one of these is missing, a behaviour is unlikely to occur. "
Foot-in-the-Door Technique,"If you get a customer to agree to a small request, they are more likely to agree to a larger request, maintaining a consistent approach to mounting requests throughout the conversation/purchase journey. "
Framing Effects,"This is the idea that the way a choice is presented to us—the words and images used or the situation in which we are given the choice—influences our decision about taking that choice. This, however, does not mean that you should mask a bad choice with attractive words or setting. "
Frequency Illusion,"This is the feeling that after you gained a new information or met a new person, you keep seeing that information or person frequently. This does not happen because the information is suddenly recurring in your environment but because you’ve never noticed it before. "
Golden Rules of Interface Design,"Ben Shneiderman has listed 8 golden rules of interface designing: 
1.Strive for consistency
2.Seek universal usability
3.Offer informative feedback
4.Design dialogs to yield closure
5.Prevent errors
6.Permit easy reversal of actions
7.Keep users in control
8.Reduce short-term memory load"
IKEA Effect/The Labour-Love Effect,The tendency of people to value something more when they have had to work for it. 
Immediacy principle ,This is the human tendency to want something immediately (NOW) rather than later. 
Information bias ,"The belief that when more information is acquired about a task or product, we would be able to make better decisions. The truth is that we don’t always need too much information to make a decision, but we tend to seek more information hoping that will help us make a better decision. "
Locus for Control,This refers to how strongly people believe they have control over the results of events in their lives. There are internal loci of control—which is the belief that you control your life and its events—and external loci of control—which is the belief that external factors control your life and events. 
Mental Models,"Mental models are our way of making sense of something, our expectations or belief about a system or process. "
Outcome Expectancy,"The outcome expectancy theory refers to the result we expect from performing a certain action or behaviour. By clearly showing the outcome of a particular effort on a website/app, users will be motivated to complete the action/transaction. Frame your outcomes to answer this question: “What results do we want?”"
Pain of paying ,"This refers to our unwillingness to part with money. This applies especially when the item is costly, payment is done after purchase of the item, or payment is done through cash instead of card. "
Perceived Value Pricing,"People perceive the value or price of an item based on the way the price is presented to them, rather than by the actual market price or financial worth. "
Personification/Metaphor Effect,"This refers to the use of a visual metaphor (through images, supported by accompanying text) to personify the emotions of the customer. The use of such an image evokes empathy in customers and makes them positively inclined towards the product or service. "
Picture superiority effect ,The tendency of people to remember pictures and graphics more than words.
Scarcity principle ,This is the human tendency to place a higher value on an object that is scarce and a lower value on those that are in abundance.
Self-efficacy,This refers to our belief in our ability to complete a task and meet challenges successfully.
Simplicity Principle,"People tend to make a faster decision when things or actions seem simple and easy to understand, even if the thing or action may not be logically easy or there are other things or actions that are logically better. "
Social Proof/Consensus Principle,People are intrinsically driven to conform and so will often be influenced to copy others’ decisions and actions. It becomes important in ambiguous social situations where people are unable to determine the appropriate mode of behaviour. 
The Paradox of Choice,"The more the choice available to customers, the more difficult it is to come to a decision. "
The Psychology of Free,"The word “free” is like magic: people will often give up a much better deal, take extra pains, or give away personal information to get the thing that is free. "
Urgency Messaging,This refers to the various triggers through which a sense of urgency can be created among buyers; urgency messages make the user feel the need to act quickly because of perceived scarcity. 
Visual cues,"Visual or directional cues are UX design techniques used to point your visitors in the direction of important elements on the page, such as CTAs. These cues help visitors navigate a webpage and maintain visual hierarchy."
Visual Fluency/Fluency Heuristic,"Similar to the simplicity principle, the theory of fluency states that of two (or more) items or services shown to a person, they are more likely to pick the item that their brain processes more fluently, the one they are able to understand faster. "
Visual Hierarchy,"This is the order in which a user takes in the information and elements on a page. The hierarchy of elements on a page is usually dictated by the visual fluency of the elements. For example, large images (or an image of any size on a page full of words), words with large or different fonts, bright or highly contrasted colours, etc. are more likely to be processed faster and therefore have a higher visual hierarchy. "
Von Restorff Effect/The Isolation Effect,"When several similar items are seen together, the item that is different from the rest will be noticed and easily remembered. "
WYSIATI (What You See Is All There Is),"This is the tendency to form impressions and judgements based only on the information that is available to us, overlooking important details that might be absent. "
